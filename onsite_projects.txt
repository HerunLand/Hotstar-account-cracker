Here are few cherry-picked projects you can work on to get acquainted with building application on the Block Chain at BlockchainU.

You're welcome to try your own projects out.

We're here to help if you need it.

- A price alert system (below or above a certain threshold, issues an audible ping)
- An IRC bot for watch-only addresses using SoChain
- An IRC tipping bot using Block.io
- A live-updating wallet interface using Block.io+SoChain
- Basic payments/invoice page using Block.io+SoChain
- A no sign-up payment system for accessing digital resources (using Block.io)
  1. User visits web page
  2. Create a new address for their IP address
  3. Wait until a payment has been received
  4. If payment is appropriate, give them an access token
  5. They can now use the access token to use the API
